  abstract = {The widespread decline of honey bee (Apis mellifera L.) colonies registered in recent years has raised great attention to the need of gathering deeper knowledge about this phenomenon, by observing the colonies’ activity to identify possible causes, and design corresponding countermeasures. In fact, honey bees have well-known positive effects on both the environment and human life, and their preservation becomes critical not only for ecological reasons, but also for the social and economic development of rural communities. Smart sensor systems are being developed for real-time and long-term measurement of relevant parameters related to beehive conditions, such as the hive weight, sounds emitted by the bees, temperature, humidity, and CO2 inside the beehive, as well as weather conditions outside. This paper presents a multisensor platform designed to measure the aforementioned parameters from beehives deployed in the field, and shows how the fusion of different sensor measurements may provide insights on the status of the colony, its interaction with the surrounding environment, and the influence of climatic conditions.},

  abstract = {Electronic beehive monitoring extracts critical information on colony behavior and phenology without invasive beehive inspections and transportation costs. As an integral component of electronic beehive monitoring, audio beehive monitoring has the potential to automate the identification of various stressors for honeybee colonies from beehive audio samples. In this investigation, we designed several convolutional neural networks and compared their performance with four standard machine learning methods (logistic regression, k-nearest neighbors, support vector machines, and random forests) in classifying audio samples from microphones deployed above landing pads of Langstroth beehives. On a dataset of 10,260 audio samples where the training and testing samples were separated from the validation samples by beehive and location, a shallower raw audio convolutional neural network with a custom layer outperformed three deeper raw audio convolutional neural networks without custom layers and performed on par with the four machine learning methods trained to classify feature vectors extracted from raw audio samples. On a more challenging dataset of 12,914 audio samples where the training and testing samples were separated from the validation samples by beehive, location, time, and bee race, all raw audio convolutional neural networks performed better than the four machine learning methods and a convolutional neural network trained to classify spectrogram images of audio samples. A trained raw audio convolutional neural network was successfully tested in situ on a low voltage Raspberry Pi computer, which indicates that convolutional neural networks can be added to a repertoire of in situ audio classification algorithms for electronic beehive monitoring. The main trade-off between deep learning and standard machine learning is between feature engineering and training time: while the convolutional neural networks required no feature engineering and generalized better on the second, more challenging dataset, they took considerably more time to train than the machine learning methods. To ensure the replicability of our findings and to provide performance benchmarks for interested research and citizen science communities, we have made public our source code and our curated datasets.},
